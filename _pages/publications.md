I've an avid reader; generally reading more than 10 articles a day. Topics that I actively track include - business strategy, software craftsmanship, agile practices, software architecture, personal improvement, productivity, communication, leadership &amp;amp; team building, life hacks, and world news.

One of the biggest challenges I face, is "knowledge managing" my reads; so that information retrieval can be as effective and pain-free as possible.

Over the years, I've used many tools ranging from the more traditional pen and paper, to digital options such as Evernote, OneNote, and Notabilitiy. These tools have exceptional note taking experiences. Unfortunately, I found the information retrieval experience to be less than ideal.

This spurred my desire to use the best information retrieval tool in the market - Google Search; this saw the birth of this blog. Apart from benefitting from the state-of-the-art information retrieval capabilities of the Google Search Engine, I also learned a lot from comments by visitors who are kind enough to share their views and correct my understanding.

Apart from capturing my learnings, I have also contribute to papers as a reviewer or co-author.

Jan, 2018 / PragPub Magazine

One of the challenges of Continuous Delivery (CD) arises when a feature spans multiple commits, and an urgent fix needs to be released before the development of that feature is complete. When a feature is completed and deployed to production, teams also need a way to experiment safely, beta testing with a small group of users and being able to roll back quickly if an undesirable experience is observed. Feature toggles to the rescue. This article explains this practice, which was common twenty years ago and is being rediscovered today.

<p class="pv-accomplishment-entity__description Sans-15px-black-70%">Due to the highly sensitive business information communicated within RFID-enabled supply chain networks, there is an urgent need for a secure and effective track &amp; trace system. In this paper, we aim to design and implement a secure track &amp; trace system (SecTTS) based on the EPCglobal network where the EPC Discovery Services (EPCDSs) is the most important component. In SecTTS, the EPCDS is designed as a semi-trusted server, contrasting the assumptions of previous works, which requires a trusted EPCDS. Our EPCDS is implemented based on the relay model where set-based relay policy is proposed to allow each supply chain partner to define different relay policies for information with different sensitivity. We implement a prototype of SecTTS and conduct extensive experiments. The results validate that our design is practical and cost effective.￼￼￼</p>

<p class="pv-accomplishment-entity__description Sans-15px-black-70%">In recent years, the Internet of Things (IOT) has drawn con- siderable attention from the industrial and research commu- nities. Due to the vast amount of data generated through IOT devices and users, there is an urgent need for an ef- fective search engine to help us make sense of this massive amount of data. With this motivation, we begin our ini- tial works on developing a secure and efficient search en- gine (SecDS) based on EPC Discovery Services (EPCDS) for EPCglobal network, an integral part of IOT. SecDS is designed to provide a bridge between different partners of supply chains to share information while enabling them to find who is in possession of an item. The most importan- t property of SecDS is: while efficiently processing user’s search, it is also secure. In order to prevent unauthorized access to SecDS, an extended attribute-based access control model is proposed and implemented such that information belonging to different companies can be protected using d- ifferent policies.</p>
