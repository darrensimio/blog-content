I've been speaking & sharing at conferences, meet-ups & user groups since 2005. I took a hiatus in 2013, before my passion to speak was reignited in 2017 at the urging of my co-working and mentors, whom I have the privilege of working with, and learning from everyday.

I speak mainly on topics relating to software development practices & tools, as well as digital strategies and the digital economy. These talks are formulated based on my years of experience as a consultant, and working at various capacities in software development teams.

If you find my experiences relevant to a conference or event that you are organizing, and will like to have me share my experiences, please feel free to reach out.

DISCLAIMER: As this page was put together after 2016, talks prior to 2017 may not have presentation resources available for sharing. In cases where I have a record of the month the talk was presented, but do not have the exact date, the first day of the month is used as a representation.
