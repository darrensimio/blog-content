I've been speaking &amp; sharing at conferences, meet-ups &amp; user groups since 2005. I took a hiatus in 2013, before my passion to speak was reignited in 2017 at the urging of my co-workers and mentors, whom I have the privilege of working with, and learning from everyday.

I speak mainly on topics relating to software development practices &amp; tools, as well as digital strategies and the digital economy. These talks are formulated based on my years of experience as a consultant, and working at various capacities in software development teams.

If you find my experiences relevant to a conference or event that you are organising, and will like to have me speak, please feel free to <a href="https://darrensim.io/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reach out</a>.

<span style="color: #999999;">DISCLAIMER: As this page was put together in 2017, presentations from speaking engagements prior to 2017 may not have presentation resources available for sharing. In cases where I have a record of the month the talk but do not have the exact date, the first day of the month is used as a representation.</span>
