Coding style is a geek topic that developers talk a lot about during coding collaboration interactions. One of the first things that come up, is usually "What case do we use"? I was in such a scenario recently, and thought I dug a little deeper to explore all the options.
<h3>Camel Case</h3>
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case</a>

Practice of writing compound words or phrases such that each word or abbreviation in the middle of the phrase begins with a capital letter, with no intervening spaces or punctuation.

<strong>Examples</strong>: johnDoe, lastConnectionDate
<h3>Pascal Case</h3>
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PascalCase" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PascalCase</a>

Practice of writing compound words or phrases such that the first letter of each concatenated word is capitalized.

<strong>Examples</strong>: JohnDoe, LastConnectionDate
<h3>Snake Case</h3>
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case</a>

Practice of writing compound words or phrases in which the elements are separated with one underscore character (_) and no spaces.

<strong>Examples</strong>: john_doe, last_connection_date
<h3>Kebab Case</h3>

<strong>Examples</strong>: John-doe, Last-connection-date
<h3>Train Case</h3>
