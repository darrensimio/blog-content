<h3>Introduction</h3>
<strong>What is 5 Voices and What does it do?</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Helps us see others, while speaking in our "native voice"</li>
 	<li>Each voice has particular attributes, and behavioural tendencies (positive and negative)</li>
 	<li>Everyone has Five Voices - all five are needed, some are louder and more natural than the others.</li>
 	<li>The most natural voice is called the <strong><em>foundation voice</em></strong>.</li>
 	<li>The prominence of the voices (our <em>foundation voice</em>) can change at different stages in our careers and lives.</li>
</ul>
<strong>PersonalÂ </strong><b>Quotient</b>
<ul>
 	<li>Ability to be self-aware</li>
 	<li>Ability to know and lead oneself</li>
 	<li>Five voices contribute to improving our PQ.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Factors Shaping our Behaviours</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Nature - this is about who we are. We need to be conscious on how our strength and weaknesses affect our behaviors.</li>
 	<li>Nurture - hugely affected by life's events and our role models. Creates a sense of "ought to" and "should be".</li>
 	<li>Choice - our behaviours are shaped by the choices we make.</li>
</ul>
