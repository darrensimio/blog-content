Almost every website that we head on to do something useful, will require us to create an account. Some of these sites have taken the approach of using popular identity providers such as <strong>Facebook</strong>, <strong>Google</strong>, <strong>Twitter</strong> &amp; <strong>Microsoft</strong>, to simplify the on-boarding experience for users.

Instead of having to fill up lengthy user information forms, a new user simply signs-in using their existing <strong>Facebook</strong>, <strong>Google</strong>, <strong>Twitter</strong> or <strong>Microsoft</strong> accounts, and their account is created. <strong>User credentials are never shared to these third-party site</strong>.

The technology enabling this is the <a href="https://oauth.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OAuth protocol</a>. At the time of writing, the latest version of this protocol is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth#OAuth_2.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OAuth 2.0</a>. Other competing protocols include <a href="http://openid.net/what-is-openid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenID</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAML_2.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SAML</a>. This <a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2016/05/30/openid-oauth-saml/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> nicely summarises the <strong><a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2016/05/30/openid-oauth-saml/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">difference between Open ID, OAuth and SAML</a></strong>.

Most consumer-focused websites support <strong>Facebook</strong>, <strong>Google</strong> and <strong>Twitter</strong> as their three primary "single-sign-on" partners. <strong>Google ID</strong> has been the more popular mechanism for authentication to consumer and business applications.

Signing up for one is FREE, and you do not need a Google Apps subscription to associate your corporate email (or non-gmail email) with a Google ID.
