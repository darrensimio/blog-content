Almost every website that we head on to do something useful, will require us to create an account. Some of these sites have taken the approach of using popular identity providers such as <strong>Facebook</strong>, <strong>Google</strong>, <strong>Twitter</strong> &amp; <strong>Microsoft</strong>, to simplify the on-boarding experience for users.

Instead of having to fill up lengthy user information forms, a new user simply signs-in using their existing <strong>Facebook</strong>, <strong>Google</strong>, <strong>Twitter</strong> or <strong>Microsoft</strong> accounts, and their account is created. <strong>User credentials are never shared to these third-party site</strong>.

The technology enabling this is the <a href="https://oauth.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OAuth protocol</a>. At the time of writing, the latest version of this protocol is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth#OAuth_2.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OAuth 2.0</a>. Other competing protocols include <a href="http://openid.net/what-is-openid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenID</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAML_2.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SAML</a>. This <a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2016/05/30/openid-oauth-saml/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> nicely summarises the <strong><a href="https://spin.atomicobject.com/2016/05/30/openid-oauth-saml/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">difference between Open ID, OAuth and SAML</a></strong>.

While most consumer-focused websites support <strong>Facebook</strong>, <strong>Google</strong> and <strong>Twitter</strong> as their three primary "single-sign-on" partners, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Account" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Google account</strong></a> has been the more popular mechanism for authentication for <strong>consumer and business applications</strong>.

Signing up for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Account" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Google account</strong></a> is FREE, and you can register for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Account" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Google account</strong></a> using your work email (or non-gmail email). You do not need a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_Suite" target="_blank" rel="noopener">G Suite</a> (previously known as Google Apps) account for this.
