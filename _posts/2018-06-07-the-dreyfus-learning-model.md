<strong>Novice</strong> – at this stage a person doesn’t really know how to be successful at what they are doing, they don’t want the big picture, but instead want unambiguous rules that will allow them to successfully accomplish their tasks. They need quick successes and will be confused when anything out of the ordinary happens.

<strong>Advanced Beginner</strong> –  want to find the information they need quickly, they have some context regarding what they are doing but still not really interested in the big picture. They can use the skill at a more competent level than a novice but will still have trouble when things go wrong.

<strong>Competent</strong> – have the ability to see the big picture and how it would affect the outcomes. They can deal with problems when something unexpected occurs they are able to draw on their experience when necessary. However their ability to reflect on what they do is still somewhat limited.

<strong>Proficient</strong> – need the big picture and will not function well without it. They can reflect on how well they are doing and draw upon their experience to improve. Can draw relevant information from the experience of others rather than taking it in as a whole.

<strong>Expert</strong> – no longer require rules and guidelines to function, will intuitively know what to do in a given situation. They will also constantly seek to find better ways of doing things.
